# Netwars

Netwars is a clone of Advance Wars Â©Nintendo. My goal is to write a responsive, clean and html5-y game.

## History

I began working on the original [netwars]() a few years ago. Written in C++ and ObjC, it was tied to Mac OS X and the code was the opposite of beautiful.
Then came Clojure. The combination of its practical approach and  LISP was just irresistible, so I started re-writing Netwars in Clojure.

## Tech

* Backend: [Clojure]()
* Frontend: [ClojureScript]()
* Transport channel: Websockets (using [Aleph]())
* Over-the-Wire format: Clojure
